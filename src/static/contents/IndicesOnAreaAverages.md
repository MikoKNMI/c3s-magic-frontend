# Predefined and user-defined indices based on area averages

Using the s2dverification package, functions will be provided to select locations or areas, compute area-averages over these regions for any pre-selected variable and combine them through addition or subtraction, with the option of including weights in these operations.
The outcome will be time series of climate indices computed for individual models. BSC will also deliver functions combining the climate indices computed from several individual models into a single climate index based on predefined metric-based (from WP4) weights.
The time series will optionally represent seasonal or multi-year averages, through either a block average or running average method.

Functions to compute pre-defined indices will be provided, including indices of model dynamics such as the QBO zonal wind index in given latitudinal band, and indices based on differences between anomalies averaged over 2 areas, such as for example the NINO 3.4 SST anomaly, SOI and NAO.
