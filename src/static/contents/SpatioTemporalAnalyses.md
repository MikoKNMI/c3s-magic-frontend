Demonstration of calculation of Indices of hydro-climatic intensity.

# Description
ISAC-CNR will deliver functions to compute climate indices derived from spatio-temporal analysis of the data, including options to combine multiple variables into a single index. In particular this task will deliver functions to compute
1. teleconnection indices based on Principal Component Analysis;
2. descriptive indices of extremes defined by ETCCDI (10), measuring characteristics of extremes, including frequency, amplitude and persistence;
3. indices of hydro-climatic intensity, such as the HY-INT index (17), integrating metrics of precipitation intensity and dry spell length;
4. indices of Northern and Southern Hemisphere annular modes, corresponding to the patterns of variability induced by stratospheric circulation changes.
Options for trend calculation will be provided, including significance testing compared to the null-hypothesis of no trend.
