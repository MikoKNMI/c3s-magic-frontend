This is the content folder of the magic portal.

You can add content to any page by editing these markdown files. Adding a page is more work, and should be done by the portal developers. It is possible to use html tags in a page. Please do so sparingly. Prime examples for using html tags are youtube embed tags, and (for now) images with an explicit size.
