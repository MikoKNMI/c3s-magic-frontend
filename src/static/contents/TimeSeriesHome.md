# Climate index time series

The objective is to compute single-model and multi-model time series of climate indices, for both pre-defined indices and indices defined interactively by the user. Next to indices based on area-averaged quantities, series will be provided that take the spatio-temporal correlations between variables and/or other data-sets into account.

Different combinations of indices between models based on weights provided will be enabled. Output will be available to the user in both graphical and numerical form.
