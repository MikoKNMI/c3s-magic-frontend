# Data used in this Portal

The Data used in this portal is CMIP5 data obtained through ESGF. Most of it resides on the compute backend running diagnostics, some is fetched from CP4CDS (ESGF based) directly.

## Demonstration video
Below a video showing the commection to the C3S CP4CDS (C3S 34a lot1) ESGF data node with Global Climate Model data. It show how the data can be searched and accessed through the MAGIC portal.

## Data discovery in previous Compute-Test Portal

This portal is the third iteration of the MAGIC portal. Though the used backend is based on the same software, not all functionality of the previous 'compute-test' portal is available yet in the frontend portal. For now, the compute-test portal complements this portal, and is available at: https://compute-test.c3s-magic.eu/impactportal/

The compute-test portal has a link to the data as provided by CP4CDS.

Before using the compute-test portal you need to sign in with an OpenID. On the compute-test portal go to [Sign In](https://compute-test.c3s-magic.eu/impactportal/account/login.jsp). Click on the 'Sign in with BADC/CEDA OpenID'. If you do not have a CEDA OpenID, you can click on 'register' to get one.

Data can be browsed and viewed in the [Data discovery](https://compute-test.c3s-magic.eu/impactportal/account/processing.jsp) section of the compute-test portal.

Browsing the (meta)data is public, for access to the data you will need to sign-in.
