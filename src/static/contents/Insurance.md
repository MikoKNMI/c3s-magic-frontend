Actuaries Climate Risk Index (ACRI)

# Description
The changing risks between the recent past and the future are of great interest to the insurance industry because even slight changes in climate characteristics can translate into large impacts on risk distribution/management and expected losses. 
Here we  will deliver functions to compute and display insurance-tailored metrics from observations and climate model simulations. 
One such example is the recently introduced Actuaries Climate Risk Index (ACRI), which aims to convey risk associated with extreme events in a statistically robust, yet easy to understand, fashion. 
Comprehensive risk indices such as the ACRI, which integrates changes in frequency and magnitude of key climate indicators and elements of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, are crucial for decision making processes.
