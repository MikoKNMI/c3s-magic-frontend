# Energy

Here we will deliver functions to compute climate indices from observations and climate model simulations to provide:
1.  energy supply indicators for a further understanding of wind power generation as changes in load factors as well as project planning to facilitate better loans and site selections;
2. energy demand indicators such as the frequency of cold spells, heat waves and a daily temperature variation indicator. Delivered functions to compute climate indices will be based on the multi-model ensemble approach to estimate ranges of reliable solutions.
