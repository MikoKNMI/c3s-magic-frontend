Cluster analysis tool based on hte k-means algorithm for ensembles of Global Climate Model simulations.

# Description
The main objective of this task is to identify the most probable outcomes from a multi-model ensemble distribution associated to a given emission scenario.

A clustering algorithm will be applied to condense the climate information from multi-model ensemble into an optimal sub-set of significantly different projections and predictions associated with a given climate forcing.
This technique is already used to characterize the most probable scenarios in an ensemble of weather forecasts (14) and this approach, applied at a regional level, can also be used to identify the sub-set of ensemble members that best represent the full range of possible solutions for downscaling applications.
The choice of the ensemble members will be made flexible in order to meet the requirements of specific (regional) climate information products, to be tailored for different regions and user needs.

For example when the optimal sub-set of precipitation predictions over Europe is used to drive a specific application, the users will be provided with the probabilistic information that is most appropriate for a risk assessment.
