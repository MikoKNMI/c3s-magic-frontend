Rain farm run using ESMValtool

# Description:
Develop software to locate relevant data sets and extract the relevant data for the water sector.
The C3S SWICCA project provides a list of climate indices which are defined through direct user interaction in a range of hydrological sectors (including agriculture and flood management), and further indices are defined for the urban case studies within UrbanSIS.

These indices will be derived from the available climate model projections.
The C3S-MAGIC software will be optimized to meet requirements of accessibility, transparency and tailor-made applicability for this range of sectors.
Output from the activities will be change indicators of relevant climate indices useful to support water management decision taking, and also for sustainability issues related to urban infrastructure.

The problem of downscaling climatic information to the needed local scales will be addressed using a simple stochastic precipitation downscaling technique developed at ISAC-CNR, which has been implemented as a postprocessing tool.
It provides high-resolution precipitation data from coarse scale GCM information, and allows a more realistic representation of subgrid precipitation variability and of precipitation extremes, crucial for impact studies in the water sector.
Downscaling of climate information is highly relevant also for extreme rainfall and flood impact for urban sustainability studies, related to the UrbanSIS project.
