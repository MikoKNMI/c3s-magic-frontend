        info_text: "The changing risks between the recent past and the future are of great interest to the insurance industry because even slight changes in climate characteristics can translate into large impacts on risk distribution/management and expected losses. Comprehensive risk indices such as the ACRI, which integrates changes in frequency and magnitude of key climate indicators and elements of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, are crucial for decision making processes."
