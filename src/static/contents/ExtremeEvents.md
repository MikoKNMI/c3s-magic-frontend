# Description
Assessing the capability of the models in reproducing the statistics of extreme events is of crucial interest for impact modelling in several of the main sectors. To this end, in order to allow to measure characteristics of extremes, including frequency, amplitude and persistence, this task will include in ESMValTool metrics to assess the model performances in simulating selected climate extremes indices for temperature and precipitation defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI).

Additionally, metrics to assess climate model precipitation simulations in terms of bias at different quantile levels (Quantile Bias) will be implemented. The intensity of the hydrological cycle, in particular precipitation extremes and droughts, and its changes in time can be characterized implementing the HY-INT index.
