# Estimate of the agreement between a selection of climate models on a future climate signal

Through the publicly available s2dverification package, BSC will deliver functions to compute and display the following types of combined model products:
1. maps (or time series) of percentage of models agreeing on the sign of (sub-)ensemble-mean anomalies and maps (or time series) of spread of the model anomalies
2. maps (or time series) of spread of the model variances for any preselected period and variable of interest
