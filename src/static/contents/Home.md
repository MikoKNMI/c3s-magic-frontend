## C3S-Magic (C3S 34a Lot2)

The Metrics and Access to Global Indices for Climate Projections (MAGIC) portal provides the functions as requested in the C3S tender “Global Climate Projections: Data Access, product generation and impact of front-line developments” (GCP). It provides solutions that allow to assess GCM projections using well-established metrics, and manipulation tools to allow tailoring the outputs to the users’ needs.

Currently it is a demonstration version of the portal, demonstrating the functionality we have prepared up to June 2018.

#### Data Discovery

The compute-test portal has a link to the data as provided by CP4CDS. Above is a video showing the commection to the C3S CP4CDS (C3S 34a lot1) ESGF data node with Global Climate Model data. It shows how the data can be searched and accessed through the MAGIC portal.

Data can be browsed and viewed live in the [Data discovery](https://compute-test.c3s-magic.eu/impactportal/account/processing.jsp) section of the compute-test portal. Browsing the (meta)data is public, for access to the data you will need to sign-in.
