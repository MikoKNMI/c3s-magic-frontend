# Multi model products

The objective of Multi model products is to combine the climate information generated by various climate models into a single estimate of any future climate signal that is optimally suited to ultimately provide the requested (sectoral) climate change information. 

This ‘optimal’ estimate will be accompanied by an estimate of the agreement between the various climate models, i.e., the robustness of this estimated future climate signal, or its dependence on underlying assumptions. 

We will also deliver tools to select a subset of representative indicators from the various future climate projections.
