# Description
Software that translates climate model output into (hourly) time series of sea surge and sea water level for a large number of coastal stations around the North Sea is adapted to the software architecture developed in C3S-MAGICS. 
To make the tool appropriate for the examination of all main aspects relevant for coastal safety, it will be extended to waves and water levels. Collaboration with Metrics and Multi-model products will focus on optimizing the selection and aggregation criteria for application in this tool.
