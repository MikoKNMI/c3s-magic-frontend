# Welcome to the C3S Magic Portal (C3S 34a Lot2)

The Metrics and Access to Global Indices for Climate Projections (MAGIC) portal provides the functions as requested in the C3S tender “Global Climate Projections: Data Access, product generation and impact of front-line developments” (GCP). It provides solutions that allow to assess GCM projections using well-established metrics, and manipulation tools to allow tailoring the outputs to the users’ needs.

Currently it is a demonstration version of the portal, demonstrating the functionality we have prepared up to November 2017.

In the different menu's you will either find working data analytic functions or sceencast movies showing metrics we will integrate into the portal.

Have fun! If comments or suggestions, please let us know.

## Demonstration video
Below a video showing the commection to the C3S CP4CDS (C3S 34a lot1) ESGF data node with Global Climate Model data. It show how the data can be searched and accessed through the MAGIC portal.

## Previous Compute-Test Portal

This portal is the third iteration of the MAGIC portal. Though the used backend is based on the same software, not all functionality of the previous 'compute-test' portal is available yet in the frontend portal. For now, the compute-test portal complements this portal, and is available at: https://compute-test.c3s-magic.eu/impactportal/

Before using the compute-test portal you need to sign in with an OpenID. On the compute-test portal go to [Sign In](https://compute-test.c3s-magic.eu/impactportal/account/login.jsp). Click on the 'Sign in with BADC/CEDA OpenID'. If you do not have a CEDA OpenID, you can click on 'register' to get one.

### Data Discovery

The compute-test portal has a link to the data as provided by CP4CDS.

Data can be browsed and viewed in the [Data discovery](https://compute-test.c3s-magic.eu/impactportal/account/processing.jsp) section of the compute-test portal.

Browsing the (meta)data is public, for access to the data you will need to sign-in.

### ESMValTool 1.1 based diagnostics

The compute-test portal is capable of running a number of ESMValTool 1.1 based diagnostics.

Diagnostics are available in the Account section on the [Processing page](https://compute-test.c3s-magic.eu/impactportal/account/processing.jsp)

On the Web processing services page, select 'compute.c3s.magic' from the dropdown list. Then you will see the available processing services from C3S-34a lot 1 MAGIC. Selections are filled with default options, so you can just press 'start processing' or adjust the default settings to you liking.
