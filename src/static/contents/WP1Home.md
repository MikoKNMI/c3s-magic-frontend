# Welcome to the C3S Magic Portal (C3S 34a Lot2)

The Metrics and Access to Global Indices for Climate Projections (MAGIC) portal provides the functions as requested in the C3S tender “Global Climate Projections: Data Access, product generation and impact of front-line developments” (GCP). It provides solutions that allow to assess GCM projections using well-established metrics, and manipulation tools to allow tailoring the outputs to the users’ needs.

Currently it is a demonstration version of the portal, demonstrating the functionality we have prepared up to November 2017.

In the different menu's you will either find working data analytic functions or sceencast movies showing metrics we will integrate into the portal.

Have fun! If comments or suggestions, please let us know.
