    Tools to compute the ensemble mean anomaly and the ensemble variance and agreement and plot the results as maps and time series.
description_long: |
    This diagnostic contains functions that will provide an integrated view of the historical evolution and projection of the climate system state in terms of the mean state, aggregating the multi-model data into a single signal. This diagnostic will also assess the ensemble variance and the agreement between ensemble members with the mean signal. ensemble mean anomalies for any variable with respect to its mean annual cycle computed on a pre-defined period. ensemble mean variance and agreement over any preselected period and variable of interest.
