This diagnostic provides an integrated view of the historical evolution and projection of the climate system state in terms of the mean state, aggregating the multi-model data into a single signal. This diagnostic assess the ensemble variance and the agreement between ensemble members with the mean signal. The anomalies for any variable with respect to a reference period is computed on any preselected period. The mean signal and agreement between methods are computed over the preselected period and variable of interest.
