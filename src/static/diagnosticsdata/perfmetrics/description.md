The goal of the PerMetrics diagnostic is to provide performance metrics to quantify the ability of the models to reproduce the climatological mean annual cycle for selected "Essential Climate Variables" (ECVs) plus some additional corresponding diagnostics and plots to better understand and interpret the results. 

The standardardized ESMValTool recipes can be used to calculate performance metrics at different vertical levels (e.g., 5, 30, 200, 850 hPa as in Gleckler et al., 2008) and in four regions (global, tropics 20°N-20°S, northern extratropics 20°-90°N, southern extratropics 20°-90°S).
