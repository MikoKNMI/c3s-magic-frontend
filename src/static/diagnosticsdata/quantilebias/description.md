The quantilebias ESMValTool recipe implements calculation of the quantile bias to allow evaluation of the precipitation bias based on a user defined quantile in models as compared to a reference dataset. The bias was shown to be typically stronger at higher quantiles (Mehran et al. 2014). 

The quantile bias (QB) is deﬁned as the ratio of monthly precipitation amounts in each simuation to that of the reference dataset (GPCP observations in the example) above a speciﬁed threshold t (e.g., the 75th percentile of all the local monthly values)
