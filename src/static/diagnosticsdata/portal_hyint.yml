description_short: | HyInt is a tool for calculation of the hydroclimatic intensity index HY-INT and additional hydroclimatic indices, which allow to evaluate the overall behaviour of the hydroclimatic cycle
description_long: | This namelist implements the HyInt tool to calculate a set of 6 indices that allow to evaluate the response of the hydrological cycle to global warming with a joint view of both wet and dry extremes. The indices were selected following Giorgi et al. (2014): the simple precipitation intensity index (SDII), the maximum dry spell length (DSL) and wet spell length (WSL), the hydroclimatic intensity index (HY-INT = normalized(SDII) x normalized(DSL)), a measure of the overall behaviour of the hydroclimatic cycle (Giorgi et al., 2011), and the precipitation area (PA), i.e. the area over which at any given day precipitation occurs, (Giorgi et al., 2014). The tool can ingest ETCDDI indices calculated by the extremeEvents namelist to perform joint analyses. Description of user-changeable settings on webpage: 1)  Selection of model; 2) Selection of period; 3)  Selection of reference normalization period: [1990,2000] # to be used for normalized indices; 4)  Selection of indices to be plotted: [1,2,3,4,8,9] # Select one or more fields from the following list (order-sensitive): SDII, DSL, WSL, HY-INT, ABS_INT, ABS_DSL, ABS_WSL, PA, R95; 5) Type of figure: 1 # 1) lon/lat maps per individual field/exp/multi-year mean, 2) lon/lat maps per individual field exp-ref-diff/multi-year mean, 3) lon/lat maps multi-field/exp-ref-diff/multi-year mean
