This namelist implements the HyInt tool to calculate a set of 6 indices that allow to evaluate the response of the hydrological cycle to global warming with a joint view of both wet and dry extremes. The indices were selected following Giorgi et al. (2014)':' the simple precipitation intensity index (SDII), the maximum dry spell length (DSL) and wet spell length (WSL), the hydroclimatic intensity index (HY-INT = normalized(SDII) x normalized(DSL)), a measure of the overall behaviour of the hydroclimatic cycle (Giorgi et al., 2011), and the precipitation area (PA), i.e. the area over which at any given day precipitation occurs, (Giorgi et al., 2014). The tool can ingest ETCDDI indices calculated by the extremeEvents namelist to perform joint analyses.
