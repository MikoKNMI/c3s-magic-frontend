    Tool to durations of heatwaves and coldwaves, to help understand changes in energy demand.
description_long: |
    This tool allows the user to compute the total duration of "extreme spells"; the total number of days in a season where the temperature exceeds a threshold over a minimum number of consecutive days. Other tools for computing such events are also available in the portal, the novelty of this tools is the user can select there own threshold (based on quantiles) and minimum duration for an event.

    Description of user-changeable settings on webpage':'
