    Tool to compute single and multi model indices based on area averages.
description_long: |
    Tool to combine indices for gridded data from a single or multiple models. The user has the option to include weights, e.g. when combining the components of the insurance risk indice a user may want to give higher weighting to the flood index for a region where flooding is the highest source of insured losses. For the area weighting, grids are assumed to be regular.

    Description of user-changeable settings on webpage':'
    Selection of whether or not to compute area-weighted averages.
    Selection of indices to combine.
    Selection of RCP scenario.
    Selection of longitudes and latitudes.
    Selection of models.
    Selection of weights.
