Tool to compute extremes indices relevant to the insurance industry. These indices are based on the ETCCDI indices, and there are currently 5 available for extreme heat, cold, wind, drought and flooding. The individual indices can be combined into a single index with or without weightings for each component. This combined index is roughly analagous to the Actuaries Climate Risk Index (http://actuariesclimateindex.org/home/).
