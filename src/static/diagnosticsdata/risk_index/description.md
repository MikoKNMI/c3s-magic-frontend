For the Risk Index metric extreme indices relevant to the insurance industry are computed. These indices are based on the ETCCDI indices, and there are currently 5 available for extreme heat (t90p), cold (t10p), wind (wx), drought(cdd) and flooding (rx5day). The individual indices can be combined into a single index with or without weightings for each component.
