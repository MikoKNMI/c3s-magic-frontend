    Tool to compute the Diurnal temperature indicator, which can be used to estimate energy demand.
description_long: |
    This tool computes the Diurnal temperature variation indicator; the number of days in a season where the daily temperature variation (tasmax - tasmin) exceeds the vulnerability threshold. Here, the vulnerability threshold is based on the mean daily temperature variation for the  reference period (1960 -1990) + 5 degrees. This definition was proposed in a study conducted for the DALKIA energy company.
