    Tool to compute modes of variability for a set of predefined regions, e.g. the Euro-North Atlantic region.
description_long: |
    Tool to compute modes of variability for a set of predefined regions. This is done by k-means clustering applied either to the anomalies for the user selected field or after computing the EOFs. The user has the option to detrend the data, e.g. for Arctic sea ice, 2nd order polynomial detrending is recommended. The output includes plots of the mean anomaly for the input field for each mode, time series of the occurence of the modes and the frequency and persistence of each mode.
